# Windmark

Windmark is a Python module designed for modeling complex, heterogeneous sequential data, where each observation is effectively a data frame. Utilizing a machine learning pipeline, Windmark automates the process of handling sequential data by leveraging the power of Flytekit for workflow orchestration and larger-than-memory streaming data preprocessing. This makes Windmark an ideal choice for data scientists and machine learning engineers who deal with time-series data, nested structures, or any form of sequential data that otherwise requires advanced preprocessing and modeling techniques.

## Features

- **Automated Machine Learning Pipeline**: Streamline the process of modeling sequential data with an automated pipeline.
- **Workflow Orchestration with Flytekit**: Utilize Flytekit to manage and scale your machine learning workflows efficiently.
- **Efficient Larger-than-Memory Data Preprocessing**: Leverage Polars for fast and memory-efficient data preprocessing.
- **Support for Complex, Heterogeneous Sequential Data**: Tailored to handle diverse sequential data formats effectively.
